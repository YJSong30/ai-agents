```
Thought: Based on the files in the directory, I have all the necessary artifacts to compile the project's technology stack. The presence of `requirements.txt` indicates Python packages used for the backend, and `package.json` suggests JavaScript-based libraries for the frontend. The Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml suggest Docker usage, and the deploy.yml file in the .github/workflows directory indicates a GitHub Actions setup for CI/CD. I'll compile this information into a detailed markdown report.

## Project Technology Stack Report

### Languages
- **Python**: Used predominantly in the backend services as indicated by the presence of `backend/main.py` and `backend/requirements.txt`.
- **JavaScript**: Used in the frontend, specifically leveraging React, as indicated by the `.jsx` and `.js` files in the `frontend/src` directory.

### Frontend Frameworks/Libraries
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, suggested by the presence of `.jsx` files and a package.json that typically includes React dependencies.

### Backend Frameworks/Libraries
- **FastAPI**: Likely used as the web framework for building the API, which is common for Python projects with `uvicorn`, as suggested by `backend/run_uvicorn.py`.

### Databases
- No explicit database files or configurations found in the repository. Further inspection of services.py or similar configuration files may be required for confirmation.

### Infrastructure/DevOps
- **Docker**: Utilized for containerization, indicated by `docker-compose.yml` and multiple `Dockerfile`s located in both `docker/backend` and `docker/frontend`.
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD pipelines are configured using GitHub Actions, as indicated by the `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.

This comprehensive report delineates the usage of Python and React as central components of the technology stack, integrated with modern DevOps practices via Docker and GitHub Actions for continuous deployment workflows.
